<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Composer is a PHP package dependency manager that XOOPS depends on. You can find out more about Composer from <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">getcomposer.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Normally Composer is executed from a command line, but there are situations where this is not possible or desired. For these situations <em>Composer Tool</em> provides a simple interface for basic Composer tasks in the form of a XOOPS Extension.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
    The <em>Composer Tool</em> is available in the XOOPS administration area. Select the Composer tab, and you will be presented with a list of common composer commands to select from. The most common are listed in the <em>Basics</em> section of the list. These commands are:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for Updates</strong> - check for updated packages</li>
        <li><strong>Update</strong> - update packages as specified in composer.json</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize autoloader</strong> - builds a highly optimized classmap for the autoloader. While this can speed up site performance, it can complicate development work. You should run this for a production system after each update.</li>
        <li><strong>Update Composer</strong> - get the latest version of Composer. This needs to be done periodically as Composer may issue errors if it is significantly out of date.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Security Check</h4
<p>
    The security check function will check any Composer installed packages against the SensioLabs security advisories database and issue a report of any relevant advisories. For more information on the SensioLabs Security Advisory Database, see <a href="https://security.sensiolabs.org/">https://security.sensiolabs.org/</a>.
